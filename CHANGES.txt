TestCentric Runner for NUnit 0.1 -

General

This is the initial release of the TestCentric Runner for NUnit. This is pre-alpha code we are releasing
primarily for the purpose of getting feedback. It is not yet recommended for use in production work.

Features

This GUI runner resembles the NUnit V2 GUI, but since it runs NUnit 3 tests the internal implementation
is entirely new. In addition, features not available or not easily supported in NUnit 3 have been
removed. Some key differences from the V2 GUI are...

 * Displaying tests as a flat list of fixtures is not supported.
 * Merging tests in the same namespace across assemblies is not supported.
 * The GUI no longer understands the layout of NUnit projectx files, which is taken care of by the 
 NUnit test engine. Consequently, menu items relating to creating, editiong and saving such files 
 are no longer present.
 * The ability to open project files, including NUnit and VS projects, is dependent on the presence
 of the approprate engine extensions, which are not bundled with the GUI.
